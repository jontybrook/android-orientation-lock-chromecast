# Google Marlin Demo Patch
by Jonty Brook - jonty@thegeeks.co - all rights reserved.

This script modifies environment properties to block automatic rotation on Android devices for demonstration purposes. It was written for the launch of the Google Pixel in order to demonstrate the phones on portrait screens over chromecast.

Note - adb must be installed and the phone must be in development mode / jailbroken.
